<h6>Hi !</h6>
<p>My name is Fousseyni. I am Phd student in Robotics and Machine Learning. I am specialized in Reinforcement Learning for Robotics navigation in Marine environment</p>

<p>But, I am passionate about all Machine Learning and Robotics subfields. That's why I started this blog so that I can share my journey with those with the same passion as me </p>

<p class="mb-5">If you also happen to have that fire burning inside, curious about everything in ML as I do, pass by sometimes and and say HI ! </p>
<p>Any way, I hope you enjoy reading as I enjoyed writing !</p>
